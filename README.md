# An Unofficial Guide to Gaussian Splatting for Nerfstudio

### Read first
__This is a forked tutorial guide and the main codes will not be updated__

This forked GitHub project is intented for folks who have little to know command-line knowledge and want to run Nerfstudio to create gaussian splats. If you have used Instant NGP, Nerfstudio, or other similar command-line based radiance field projects, most likely you have already installed some or all of the depedencies required for this project.

I created two walkthrough videos to compliment the tutorial (coming soon). You can watch them independently or with this project page as reference. Please follow my YT channel for additional updates. Now let's get gaussian splatting with Nerfstudio!

# About Nerfstudio

_It’s as simple as plug and play with nerfstudio!_

Nerfstudio provides a simple API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and testing NeRFs.
The library supports a **more interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component.**
With more modular NeRFs, we hope to create a more user-friendly experience in exploring the technology.

This is a contributor-friendly repo with the goal of building a community where users can more easily build upon each other's contributions.
Nerfstudio initially launched as an opensource project by Berkeley students in [KAIR lab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/index.html#kair) at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in October 2022 as a part of a research project ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04264)). It is currently developed by Berkeley students and community contributors.

We are committed to providing learning resources to help you understand the basics of (if you're just getting started), and keep up-to-date with (if you're a seasoned veteran) all things NeRF. As researchers, we know just how hard it is to get onboarded with this next-gen technology. So we're here to help with tutorials, documentation, and more!

Have feature requests? Want to add your brand-spankin'-new NeRF model? Have a new dataset? **We welcome [contributions](https://docs.nerf.studio/reference/contributing.html)!** Please do not hesitate to reach out to the nerfstudio team with any questions via [Discord](https://discord.gg/uMbNqcraFc).

Have feedback? We'd love for you to fill out our [Nerfstudio Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/sqN5phJN7LfQVwnP9) if you want to let us know who you are, why you are interested in Nerfstudio, or provide any feedback!

We hope nerfstudio enables you to build faster :hammer: learn together :books: and contribute to our NeRF community :sparkling_heart:.

# Getting Started



## 1. Installation: Setup the environment

### Prerequisites

You must have an NVIDIA video card with CUDA installed on the system. This library has been tested with version 11.8 of CUDA. You can find more information about installing CUDA [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/index.html)

### Create environment

Nerfstudio requires `python >= 3.8`. We recommend using conda to manage dependencies. Make sure to install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/miniconda.html) before proceeding.

```bash
conda create --name nerfstudio -y python=3.8
conda activate nerfstudio
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Dependencies

Install PyTorch with CUDA (this repo has been tested with CUDA 11.7 and CUDA 11.8) and [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn).
`cuda-toolkit` is required for building `tiny-cuda-nn`.

You can check which version of CUDA Toolkit you have installed by entering `nvcc --version` into command prompt. Use the instructions below that match your version of CUDA Toolkit to install PyTorch.

For CUDA 11.7:

```bash
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu117 torchvision==0.15.2+cu117 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1" cuda-toolkit
pip install ninja git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```

For CUDA 11.8:

```bash
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda-toolkit
pip install ninja git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```

See [Dependencies](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/blob/main/docs/quickstart/installation.md#dependencies)
in the Installation documentation for more.

### Installing nerfstudio

You will need to build Nerfstudio from code to access guassian splatting.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio.git
cd nerfstudio
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -e .
```


## 2. Training your first model!

The following will train a _nerfacto_ model, our recommended model for real world scenes.

```bash
# Download some test data:
ns-download-data nerfstudio --capture-name=poster
# Train model
ns-train nerfacto --data data/nerfstudio/poster
```

If everything works, you should see training progress like the following:

</p>

Navigating to the link at the end of the terminal will load the webviewer. If you are running on a remote machine, you will need to port forward the websocket port (defaults to 7007).

</p>

### Resume from checkpoint / visualize existing run

It is possible to load a pretrained model by running

```bash
ns-train nerfacto --data data/nerfstudio/poster --load-dir {outputs/.../nerfstudio_models}
```

## Visualize existing run

Given a pretrained model checkpoint, you can start the viewer by running

```bash
ns-viewer --load-config {outputs/.../config.yml} --vis viewer_beta
```

## 3. Exporting Results

Once you have a NeRF model you can either render out a video or export a gaussian splat ply.

### Render Video

First we must create a path for the camera to follow. This can be done in the viewer under the "RENDER" tab. Orient your 3D view to the location where you wish the video to start, then press "ADD CAMERA". This will set the first camera key frame. Continue to new viewpoints adding additional cameras to create the camera path. We provide other parameters to further refine your camera path. Once satisfied, press "RENDER" which will display a modal that contains the command needed to render the video. Kill the training job (or create a new terminal if you have lots of compute) and run the command to generate the video.

Other video export options are available, learn more by running

```bash
ns-render --help
```

### Generate a Guassian Splat

Currently, this must be performed with command line. You can export the splat ply by running

```bash
ns-export gassian-splat --load-config {outputs/.../config.yml} --export-dir {path/to/directory}
```


Learn about the export options by running

```bash
ns-export gaussian-splat --help
```

## 4. Using Custom Data

Using an existing dataset is great, but likely you want to use your own data! We support various methods for using your own data. Before it can be used in nerfstudio, the camera location and orientations must be determined and then converted into our format using `ns-process-data`. We rely on external tools for this, instructions and information can be found in the documentation.

## 5. Advanced Options

### Training models other than nerfacto

We provide other models than nerfacto, for example if you want to train the original nerf model, use the following command

```bash
ns-train vanilla-nerf --data DATA_PATH
```

For a full list of included models run `ns-train --help`.

### Modify Configuration

Each model contains many parameters that can be changed, too many to list here. Use the `--help` command to see the full list of configuration options.

```bash
ns-train nerfacto --help
```
